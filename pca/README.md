→ VIF Analysis → PowerTransformer → PCA (SVD & Eigen) 
→ Validation → Classification
```

## 📊 Key Sections

### 1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
- Minimal cleaning: removes ID column and artifact column (`Unnamed: 32`)
- Binary label encoding: M=1 (Malignant), B=0 (Benign)
- **Skewness Analysis:** 22/30 features have |skew| > 1
- **Outliers:** All 30 features contain z-score outliers (|z| > 3)
- **PowerTransformer (Yeo-Johnson):** Applied to handle non-normal distributions
  - Improves recall for malignant class from 0.8810 → 0.9524

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution analysis (histograms with seaborn)
- Skewness and kurtosis metrics
- Outlier detection using z-scores
- Class balance assessment

### 3. **Multicollinearity Diagnosis**
- **Pearson Correlation Matrix:** Identifies highly correlated feature pairs
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Groups correlated features using dendrogram
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** Quantifies multicollinearity severity
  - Features with VIF > 10 indicate severe multicollinearity
  - Many features exceed this threshold before PCA

### 4. **Principal Component Analysis Implementation**

#### From Scratch (Two Methods):
1. **SVD-Based PCA:** Direct singular value decomposition
2. **Eigenvalue-Based PCA:** Covariance matrix eigendecomposition

#### Key Outputs:
- Principal components (loadings/weights)
- Explained variance ratio per component
- Cumulative explained variance
- Transformed data in reduced space

#### Validation:
- Custom implementation validated against `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`
- Numerical equivalence verified for transformed data and explained variance

### 5. **Explained Variance Analysis**
- Scree plot: cumulative explained variance vs. number of components
- **Optimal component selection:** 3 components retain 75% of total variance
- Trade-off analysis: Just 3 components reduce dimensions by 90% while retaining most information

### 6. **Classification Pipeline**

#### Models Evaluated:
- Logistic Regression with 3 PCA components versus 30 original features
- Pipeline: `StandardScaler → PowerTransformer → PCA → LogisticRegression`

#### Metrics Computed:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-validation scores (stratified k-fold)

## 📈 Results Summary

### Classification Performance (Logistic Regression with PowerTransformer)

| Metric | Without PCA (30 features) | With PCA (3 components) | Difference |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Accuracy | 0.9825 (98.25%) | 0.9737 (97.37%) | −0.88% |
| Precision (Malignant) | 0.9722 | 0.9608 | −1.14% |
| Recall (Malignant) | **0.9524** | **0.9524** | ✅ Tied |
| F1-Score (Malignant) | 0.9621 | 0.9565 | −0.56% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.9983 | 0.9974 | −0.09% |

### Efficiency Gains (PCA with 3 components)

| Metric | Without PCA | With PCA (3) | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Features Retained | 30 | 3 | **90% reduction** |
| Variance Captured | 100% | 75.01% | — |
| Memory Usage | 106.6 KB | 10.7 KB | **10× reduction** |
| Training Time | baseline | ~3× faster | **~3× speedup** |

**Key Finding:** After PowerTransformer (Yeo-Johnson) correction, PCA achieves **10× compression with <1% accuracy cost and tied recall** for malignant classification.

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Multicollinearity:** Original 30 features exhibit severe multicollinearity (VIF up to 63,306), but PCA effectively decorrelates them
- **Normality Matters:** PowerTransformer (Yeo-Johnson) correction is critical—it improved recall from 0.8810 → 0.9524 when combined with PCA, closing the gap entirely with the no-PCA baseline
- **Optimal Compression:** Just **3 components capture 75% of variance** while reducing memory by 10× and training time by ~3×
- **Accuracy-Recall Trade-off:** <1% accuracy loss (98.25% → 97.37%) while maintaining equal recall on malignant cases—excellent trade-off for production efficiency
